## Business Activities

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

With the emergence of Cryptocurrencies and its integration into the global economy we have only seen the start of what this transformative technology has to offer. From circumventing potential risks to detecting fraud, there are a lot of things to stay on top of. With the help of regulatory technology solutions such as those provided by Chainalysis, it is possible to improve, streamline, and automate the regulatory processes. This will allow for cryptocurrencies to sustain its growth and integrate into the new global financial infrastructure.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Chainalysis intended customer base are government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions, insurance companies and cybersecurity companies.

According to a research report published by _MarketsandMarkets_, the global RegTech market size is expected to grow to jaw-dropping valuation of 19.5 billion dollars by 2026 and 21.73 billion by 2027 according to a report by _Reports and Data_ as more companies continue to enter the RegTech space.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

Whether its Compliance, Investigations, DeFi or NFTs Chainalysis understands the day-to-day workings of the crypto ecosystem and is better suited than other vendors to help its customers support their compliance program and protect their customers. Chainalysis provides an easy-to-use user interface, reporting tools and product suite that is designed with different players within the crypto ecosystem such as financial institutions, exchanges, and others. Customers utilize Chainalysis KYT and Reactor solutions to identify and mitigate risk and inspire confidence in their business partners. Other products include Krytos, Market Intel and Business Data. These products help turn blockchain transactions into insight and risk into compliance. I wouldn’t necessarily say the Chainalysis has an “unfair advantage that they utilize” however they do offer a suite of highly sophisticated software services that integrates extremely well with customer platforms and if that wasn’t enough, Chainalysis has assisted in some of the most high-profile criminal cases in the blockchain industry. Chainalysis’ 2022 Crypto Crime Report highlights the breadth of research and analysis the firm has undertaken over the last twelve months, along with a detailed breakdown of illicit on-chain activities.

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**

Chainalysis technologies include a suite of blockchain analysis software designed for financial institutions, insurance agencies, government agencies, cryptocurrency exchanges among others. Their products enable customers to receive the report of customers cryptocurrency-related activities, visualize, investigate and detect the illegal sale of customer data and ransomware cases, as well as identify revenue and cash-outs. Features include anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customers (KYC) compliance obligation, due diligence enhancement, real-time issuance and redemption monitoring, and multi-currency support.

## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

The business impacts of Chainalysis are far and wide reaching. One such example is how Chainalysis is, right now, doing millions of dollars’ worth of business each year with the U.S. government, dwarfing its competitors in the young industry of blockchain surveillance. Chainalysis has become the crypto analysis contractor of choice for more than a dozen federal agencies including the IRS as well as a couple US military branches. In 2015 Chainalysis started with a $9,000 data software contract from the FBI and within a 5-year period they increased that government contract to over $10 million and continues to grow exponentially year over year since.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

Most of the financial metrics for Chainalysis are difficult to come by as the company is a privately held firm and not publicly traded however, according to the company’s website, on May 12,2022  _Chainalysis, the blockchain data platform, today announced a $170 million Series F financing led by GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, bringing its valuation to $8.6 billion. Previous investors Accel, Blackstone, Dragoneer, and FundersClub increased their investment in the company, and the Bank of New York Mellon and Emergence Capital also participated. Chainalysis is now the largest enterprise SaaS company in the cryptocurrency industry and will use the funds to continue to invest in product innovation and scale its global operations to meet customer demand as the asset class gains mainstream acceptance._ _While government bodies have long realized the importance of blockchain data and analysis, in the past year the demand for risk management and business intelligence solutions from exchanges and DeFi platforms scaling their businesses and financial institutions entering the cryptocurrency space reached new highs._

Over the past year, Chainalysis has:

- Increased its customer count by 75% and now has more than 750 customers in 70 countries.

- Doubled its private sector customer base and tripled its financial services customer base, and now counts more than 100 financial institutions as customers.

- Increased the number of customers that account for more than $100k in annual recurring revenue by 75% to 150 customers.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

Chainalysis has become the industry leader within their domain. The growth status of Chainalysis is exploding with a 5-year search growth rate of 787% for Blockchain analysis and anti-money laundering software for intuitions dealing with cryptocurrencies.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)**

Sometimes less is more! I would suggest that Chainalysis not expand their product offerings at this time and continue to focus its efforts on enhancing its current solutions. Continue to develop best in class products and services.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

I believe this course of action would benefit Chainalysis as they are currently looking to fill many openings, 113 positions globally in fact. Considering their current staffing level of approximately 700 employees that’s a 16% increase in required personnel to just fill its current openings. Given the fact that Chainalysis is still a relatively new company and has experienced exceptional growth in its first 7 years it should be careful not to expand to quickly which could be detrimental to the company. Therefore, it would be prudent to remain focused on the current product line opposed to expanding it at this time.
